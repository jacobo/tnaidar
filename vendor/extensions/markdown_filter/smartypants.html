<h4>Description</h4>

<p>
SmartyPants easily translates plain ASCII punctuation characters
into &#8220;smart&#8221; typographic punctuation HTML entities.
</p>

<p>
SmartyPants can perform the following transformations:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Straight quotes ( &#34; and &#39; ) into &#8220;curly&#8221; quote HTML entities
</li>

<li>
Backticks-style quotes (<code>``like this''</code>) into &#8220;curly&#8221; quote HTML entities
</li>

<li>
Dashes (&#8220;<code>--</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>---</code>&#8221;) into en- and em-dash entities
</li>

<li>
Three consecutive dots (&#8220;<code>...</code>&#8221;) into an ellipsis entity
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This means you can write, edit, and save your pages using plain old
ASCII straight quotes, plain dashes, and plain dots, but your published
pages (and final HTML output) will appear with smart quotes, em-dashes,
and proper ellipses.
</p>

<p>
SmartyPants does not modify characters within <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag blocks. Typically, these tags are used to display text where smart quotes and other &#8220;smart punctuation&#8221; would not be appropriate, such as source code or example markup.
